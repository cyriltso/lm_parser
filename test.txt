Dear Mr.Duret :
From the IT services and consulting web site, I learned your need for Buisness Analyst as part of your IT department employment. I'm very interested in this position with Meritis corporation, and believe that my education and employment experience are appropriate for the position. 
You indicate that a requirement for the position is a management of IT technologies used in your project client. I'm in the beginning of my Master degree in Data-Science in engineering school. I'm developing my sense of Data-analyst with every project I made until today. For instance, I worked on the analyst project which consisted to find out links between many data using statistics to build a strategy as part of a problematics. I have real sense of mathematical tools and improve my background using analyst software like R environment. I'm very curious and I enjoy working in a team and believe my sense of understanding people is very important for this position.
